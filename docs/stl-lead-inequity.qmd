```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
stl_lead <- read_csv(here::here("data", "stl_lead.csv")) %>% clean_names()
```

```{r}
stl_lead_prop = stl_lead %>% dplyr::mutate(prop_white = 100*(stl_lead$white / stl_lead$total_pop))
```

```{r}
stl_lead_plot <- ggplot(data = stl_lead_prop, aes(x = pct_elevated, y = prop_white, alpha = count_tested), height = 5, width = 6) + geom_point()

ggsave(here::here("figs", "stl_lead_plot.png"), height = 5, width = 6)
```

There is a somewhat strong negative relationship between the percent of children with elevated blood lead levels and the percentage of census that is white.

```{r}
elevated_hist <- ggplot(data = stl_lead_prop, aes(x = pct_elevated)) + geom_histogram(color = "blue", bins = 40, fill = "orange")
```
